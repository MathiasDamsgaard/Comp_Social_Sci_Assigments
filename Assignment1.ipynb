The goal is the following: (i) get as many names as possible including: keynote speakers, chairs, authors of parallel talks and authors of posters; (ii) ensure that the collected names are complete and accuarate as reported in the website (e.g. both first name and family name); (iii) ensure that no name is repeated multiple times with slightly different spelling. \n",

    ">    * You can use the [find_all](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#find-all) method to find elements that match specific filters. Check the [documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) of the library for detailed explanations on how to set filters.  \n",
    ">    * Parse the strings to ensure that you retrieve \"clean\" author names (e.g. remove commas, or other unwanted charachters)\n",
    ">    * The overall idea is to adapt the procedure I have used [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/lalessan/comsocsci2023/blob/master/additional_notebooks/ScreenScraping.ipynb) for the specific page you are scraping. \n",
    "> 3. Create the set of unique researchers that joined the conference and *store it into a file*.\n",
    ">     * *Important:* If you notice any issue with the list of names you have collected (e.g. duplicate/incorrect names), come up with a strategy to clean your list as much as possible. \n",
    "> 4. *Optional:* For a more complete represenation of the field, include in your list: (i) the names of researchers from the programme committee of the conference, that can be found at [this link](https://ic2s2-2023.org/program_committee); (ii) the organizers of tutorials, that can be found at [this link](https://ic2s2-2023.org/tutorials)"

We used this fact and extracted all the “i” tags from the rest of the webpage and handled three cases: names starting with ‘Chair:’, comma-separated names, and single names. This could be done as only names were written in italic, and we were therefore fairly confident we got about all the names out. \n",

Often people are aware they are participating in an experiment, potentially making them reactive and behave a certain way. In Centola's experiment they did the study without letting the subjects knowing there was a test and control group, hence making their behaviour more believable.\n",
    "- It is often opposite for ready-made data, where you have access to big data, but not all of it may be useful to you. It requires a lot of clean-up and consideration of the truthfulness of the data.

    "- When making the choice of using either custom-made or ready-made data, the researchers must consider the benefits and consequences of that choice, here some of them were explained previously. If they fail to properly interpret possible trends, the relevancy, representativeness, or a possible confounder for the behaviour, the analysis suddenly losses its reliability. Here custom-made data will always be more reliable, but its higher cost and smaller sample size can lead to a skewed distribution of participants. These differences makes it hard of whether to rely on big data or not as the ten common characteristics also highlights relevant problems, some of which have already been explained. To do the necessary groundwork is therefore important, and if the considerations are properly presented, the influence of it on the results in a study as Nicolaides’ will become smaller."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "> **Exercise : Collecting Research Articles from IC2S2 Authors**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">In this exercise, we'll leverage the OpenAlex API to gather information on research articles authored by participants of the IC2S2 2023 conference, referred to as *IC2S2 authors*. **Before you start, please ensure you read through the entire exercise.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Steps:**\n",
    ">  \n",
    "> 1. **Retrieve Data:** Starting with the *authors* you identified in Week 2, Exercise 2, use the OpenAlex API [works endpoint](https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works) to fetch the research articles they have authored. For each article, retrieve the following details:\n",
    ">    - _id_: The unique OpenAlex ID for the work.\n",
    ">    - _publication_year_: The year the work was published.\n",
    ">    - _cited_by_count_: The number of times the work has been cited by other works.\n",
    ">    - _author_ids_: The OpenAlex IDs for the authors of the work.\n",
    ">    - _title_: The title of the work.\n",
    ">    - _abstract_inverted_index_: The abstract of the work, formatted as an inverted index.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">     **Important Note on Paging:** By default, the OpenAlex API limits responses to 25 works per request. For more efficient data retrieval, I suggest to adjust this limit to 200 works per request. Even with this adjustment, you will need to implement pagination to access all available works for a given query. This ensures you can systematically retrieve the complete set of works beyond the initial 200. Find guidance on implementing pagination [here](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/get-lists-of-entities/paging#cursor-paging).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. **Data Storage:** Organize the retrieved information into two Pandas DataFrames and save them to two files in a suitable format:\n",
    ">    - The *IC2S2 papers* dataset should include: *id, publication\\_year, cited\\_by\\_count, author\\_ids*.\n",
    ">    - The *IC2S2 abstracts* dataset should include: *id, title, abstract\\_inverted\\_index*.\n",
    ">  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Filters:**\n",
    "> To ensure the data we collect is relevant and manageable, apply the following filters:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">    - Only include *IC2S2 authors* with a total work count between 5 and 5,000.\n",
    ">    - Retrieve only works that have received more than 10 citations.\n",
    ">    - Limit to works authored by fewer than 10 individuals.\n",
    ">    - Include only works relevant to Computational Social Science (focusing on: Sociology OR Psychology OR Economics OR Political Science) AND intersecting with a quantitative discipline (Mathematics OR Physics OR Computer Science), as defined by their [Concepts](https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works/work-object#concepts). *Note*: here we only consider Concepts at *level=0* (the most coarse definition of concepts). \n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Efficiency Tips:**\n",
    "> Writing efficient code in this exercise is **crucial**. To speed up your process:\n",
    "> - **Apply filters directly in your request:** When possible, use the [filter parameter](https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works/filter-works) of the *works* endpoint to apply the filters above directly in your API request, ensuring only relevant data is returned. Learn about combining multiple filters [here](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/get-lists-of-entities/filter-entity-lists).  \n",
    "> - **Bulk requests:** Instead of sending one request for each author, you can use the [filter parameter](https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works/filter-works) to query works by multiple authors in a single request. *Note: My testing suggests that can only include up to 25 authors per request.*\n",
    "> - **Use multiprocessing:** Implement multiprocessing to handle multiple requests simultaneously. I highly recommmend [Joblib’s Parallel](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) function for that, and [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/) can help monitor progress of your jobs. Remember to stay within [the rate limit](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/rate-limits-and-authentication) of 10 requests per second.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   \n",
    "> For reference, employing these strategies allowed me to fetch the data in about 30 seconds using 5 cores on my laptop. I obtained a dataset of approximately 25 MB (including both the *IC2S2 abstracts* and *IC2S2 papers* files).\n",
