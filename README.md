# Assignment repository for 02467 Computational Social Science

In this repository the raw explainer notebook for the final project can be found under the name _Project.ipynb_, which contain all the relevant code along with clarifications and explanations on the workflow and decisions taken, in addition to the previous two assignments in this course.
All data small enough is also available under the _data/_ folder. However, for practical reasons with running Github Pages properly the webpage can instead be found under a [separate repository](https://github.com/MathiasDamsgaard/Comp_Social_Sci_Webpage). Shared versions of all the relevant data files can be found in [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ds2DuMk6-3qzciHKSTfHVpAQfmKQm407?usp=sharing).
The final webpage is hosted under [this link](https://mathiasdamsgaard.github.io/Comp_Social_Sci_Webpage/).
